Hey! I'm Chaseyy! \[They/He]. I'm a primarily backend developer who very rarely puts projects on GitHub! 

I have experience working with Python, common WebDev languages such as HTML, CSS and JS (i hate js /hj), Java, C#, and more. 

Currently, I am taking a Tafe course in ICT, teaching me skills in the areas of Network Engineering, intro to Python and intro to WebDev
